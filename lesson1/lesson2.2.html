                 <caption> <h1>Death Note rules</h1> </caption>
        <li>These are the full-page rules provided at the end of manga chapters titled "How to Use It," and they are the main rules of the series. </li>
        <li>The rules are essentially identical in the anime, and are the original rules on which the other adaptations are based.</li>
        <li>The first five rules are the ones Ryuk wrote in the Death Note, and which are provided with the first "How to Use It" page:
          <ol>
            <li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li>
            <li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.</li>
            <li>If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.</li>
            <li>If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.</li>
            <li>After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
